## Coding style

### Format

Use clang-format

1. Install clang-format clang tool. Probably, any version will be ok, but the newer the better.
2. You'll need to integrate git and clang-format.
   * For that, you will need to download git-clang-format from here or here.
   * Read it to check for nastiness.
   * Put it somewhere in your path (e.g. ~/bin or /usr/local/bin) and ensure   that it is executable (chmod +x).
3. Now, step into your local clone of repository:
   * cd `.git/hooks`
   * If you previously did not have a pre-commit hook:
     * cp pre-commit.sample pre-commit && chmod +x pre-commit
   * Open pre-commit with your favourite text editor, and append before the last block, here is how the end should look:
     ```
     # format everything
     res=$(git clang-format --diff | wc -l)
     if [ $res -ne 1 ]
     then
     	git clang-format
     	echo "Commit did not match clang-format"
     	exit 1;
     fi
     
     # If there are whitespace errors, print the offending file names and fail.
     exec git diff-index --check --cached $against --
     ```
